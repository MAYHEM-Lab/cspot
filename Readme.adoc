== Installation

Currently, CSPOT builds from source using a bash installation script on CentOS
7.  It requires docker ce, which it will install, but to do so it will remove
the docker package that ships with CentOS 7.  To install CSPOT

[source sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/MAYHEM-Lab/cspot.git
cd cspot
sudo ./install-centos7.sh
