== Installation

Currently, CSPOT builds from source using a bash installation script on CentOS
7.  It requires docker ce, which it will install, but to do so it will remove
the docker package that ships with CentOS 7.  To install CSPOT

[source sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/MAYHEM-Lab/cspot.git
cd cspot
sudo ./install-centos7.sh
sudo ./SELF-TEST.sh
----
The self test will run 5 latency tests and a throughput test using 100 puts.  The output should show latencies for all of the tests.  For example, 
[source sh]
----
avg latency: 399.088000 ms
avg latency: 2.939000 ms
avg latency: 2.649000 ms
avg latency: 2.821000 ms
avg latency: 2.907000 ms
seq_no 1 latency 2.351000
seq_no 2 latency 3.535000
.
.
.
seq_no 98 latency 47.380000
seq_no 99 latency 49.361000
seq_no 100 latency 48.209000
avg throughput: 28.828845 puts/s
