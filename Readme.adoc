== Installation

Currently, CSPOT builds from source using a bash installation script on CentOS
7.  It requires docker ce, which it will install, but to do so it will remove
the docker package that ships with CentOS 7.  To install CSPOT

[source sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/MAYHEM-Lab/cspot.git
cd cspot
sudo ./install-centos7.sh
sudo ./SELF-TEST.sh
----
The self test will run 5 latency tests and a throughput test using 100 puts.  The output should show latencies for all of the tests.  For example, 
[source sh]
----
avg latency: 399.088000 ms
avg latency: 2.939000 ms
avg latency: 2.649000 ms
avg latency: 2.821000 ms
avg latency: 2.907000 ms
seq_no 1 latency 2.351000
seq_no 2 latency 3.535000
.

# Overview

CSPOT is acronym (slightly reordered) for _Serverless Platform of Things
in C_. It is an empirical coding experiment that amalgamates
``Serverless'' computing (i.e. Functions as a Service – FaaS) and
distributed computing principles targeting Internet of Things (IoT)
applications.

The goal of CSPOT is to explore the interplay between application
programming abstractions, runtime systems and operating systems in a
tiered cloud setting. The design presupposes that IoT sensors and
actuators will communicate with computing elements at the ``edge'' of
the network (e.g. edge clouds that can implement public cloud services
near where data is gathered and actuation occurs). Edge computing, in
turn, may need to employ resources at a regional level (e.g. a private
cloud) or more globally (e.g. in a public cloud).

CSPOT attempts to layer a platform across these three tiers that
supports a common set of low-level abstractions for programmers to use
to construct applications. The programming model that CSPOT supports is
one akin to ``Functions as a Service'' in which control-flow is event
driven. Thus a CSPOT program consists of events triggered by functions
applied to a distributed set of storage objects that are implemented as
part of a single, common storage abstraction.

The initial implementation and its test applications use C as the
programming language. However, functions execute within Linux containers
making it possible to employ a mixed-language programming approach.

== Current CSPOT Abstractions

The current implementation supports three primary programming
abstractions: * Wide-area Objects of Functions (WOOFs) – Append-only
storage objects capable of persisting data in fixed-sized elements *
Handlers – Functions that may be triggered by the platform when data is
appended to a WOOF * Namespaces – Collections of WOOFs that share a
common name prefix

The intention is to begin with a minimal set of abstractions and API
semantics and to expand as needed. Performance optimization, in
particular, may drive modification and or expansion of the API
semantics.

=== Namespaces

Each namespace defines a flat space for storing WOOFs and handler code.
Each namespace is located on some host within the system. While yet to
be implemented, the intention is to implement access control between
namespaces. Initially, each namespace corresponds to a top level
directory on a Linux host that contains related state (WOOFs and handler
code).

=== WOOFs

A WOOF is an append-only sequence of fix-sized memory regions (called
elements) managed as a circular buffer. The size of each element in a
WOOF as well as the history size (the maximal number of the most recent
appends to the WOOF) are specified when the WOOF is created and cannot
be changed. CSPOT does not interpret the content of each memory element.
However it does assign a unique 64-bit sequence number to each element
when the element has been successfully added to a WOOF.

Note that the historical capacity of a WOOF is programmer-determined.
When the circular buffer wraps, the oldest data in the WOOF is simply
overwritten. However, the sequence number space for each WOOF does not
wrap.

=== The CSPOT API

The current WOOF C-language API consists of the following API calls

[source c]
----
int WooFCreate(char *woof_name, unsigned long element_size, unsigned long history_size)
----
* creates a WooF with fixed-sized elements and specified history size
* *woof_name* is the local or fully qualified name of the WOOF to create
* *element_size* refers to the number of bytes in a memory region
* *history_size* refers to the number of elements (not bytes) in the WOOF history
* returns < 0 on failure
[source c]
----
unsigned long WooFPut(char *woof_name, char *handler_name, void *element)
----
* *woof_name* is the local or fully qualified name of an existing WOOF
* *handler_name* is the name of a file in the WOOF’s namespace that contains the handler code or NULL. When #handler_name# is NULL, no handler will be triggered after the append of the element.
* *element* is an in parameter that points to an memory region to be appended to the WOOF
* the call returns the sequence number of the element or a representation of -1 on failure
[source c]
----
int WooFGet(char woof_name, void element, unsigned long long seq_no)
----
* *woof_name* is the local or fully qualified name of an existing WOOF
* *element* is an in parameter that points to an memory region to be set to the contents of the element from the WOOF (i.e. an out parameter)
* *seq_no* is the sequence number, from the WOOF, of the element to be retrieved (sequence number zero is not a valid sequence number and, thus, when specified in a call WooFGet() returns the element having the largest sequence number stored in the WOOF). If the sequence number is invalid (i.e. out of the range of sequence numbers in the WOOF) an error is returned.
[source c]
----
void WooFInit()
----
* allows a Linux process external to CSPOT to make called to *WooFPut()*
* reads its parameters from environment variables that the calling process must set

This API definition is, more or less, stable. There is an internal API
for implementing ``fast-path'' WOOF accesses, but it is not maintained
in the current release and is definitely subject to change.

There are several features of the API that, perhaps, require some
scrutiny.

First, this is the complete API (a WooFRemove() call will be included in
a future release). A well-formed CSPOT program uses WOOFs as its only
data structures and WooFCreate(), WooFPut(), and WooFGet() are the only
operations supported for those data structures.

Secondly, only a call to WooFPut() causes a computation to be initiated.
That is, CSPOT requires that program state be appended to a WOOF as a
prerequisite to executing a computation. As a result, the elements
stored in a program’s set of WOOFs represent the full program state in
the event of failure and the program can be resumed from that state.
Parsing the program state so that the program can be resumed is not
currently automated.

Thirdly, handlers are concurrent and may execute out of order with
respect to their invocation. Synchronization occurs when a sequence
number is assigned to an element when it is appended to a WOOF. That is,
a call to WooFPut() will append the element and return a sequence number
as a transaction. Note that there are no primitives for synchronizing
handlers beyond this transaction.

Lastly, WooFInit() is included as an optimization that allows CSPOT
client applications ``join'' a namespace. By default, each WOOF is
addressed by a URN and when the API code parses the WOOF name, if the
name is fully qualified, the request will generate a network request and
response. As a local optimization, it is possible to address WOOFs by
path name, but to do so, the process must initialize the namespace
state. WooFInit() is a primitive that implements this initialization.

==== WOOF Names

WOOF names are either interpreted locally, with respect to the namespace
of the handler that is referring to them or fully qualified as a URI
beginning with the string ``woof://''. A name must be unique within each
namespace. If the prefix of the name string is ``woof://'' the remainder
of the string is interpreted by the current implementation as an
absolute path to the WOOF on the host where it is located. If not, it is
interpreted relative to the namespace path for the referring handler.

Additionally, each namespace must contain binary files carrying the
handlers that can be executed on WOOFs within the namespace. The handler
names and the WOOF names must not conflict.

==== WOOF Handlers

Each WOOF handler must have the following function signature as its
top-level entry point

[source c]
----
int HandlerName(WOOF *woof, unsigned long seq_no, void *element)
----

When the CSPOT runtime system invokes the handler, it will pass an
opaque handle for the WOOF, the sequence number of the element that the
handler is to handle, and a pointer to the element. The handler should
return a value >= on success and < 0 on failure. Handlers should not
persist state other than by calling *WooFPut()* on one or more
WOOFs (possibly creating them when needed).

== The CSPOT Runtime

Each WOOF is implemented as a memory-mapped file within a namespace.  Handlers run within a Docker container associated with the namespace
that contains them. Thus, the CSPOT platform creates a container
per name space 
maps all WOOFs referred to in an API call into the address space of the
handler making the call. Thus, it is necessary to start a platform
component for each namespace. Currently each namespace platform must be
started manually using the commands

....
woofc-namespace-platform -N path-to-namespace
....

The namespace platform must be executing before any puts to a namespace
activate. That is, the platform is intended to function as a long
running daemon that services the namespace for all applications that
access WOOFs contained within it.

The namespace platform creates an internal append-only log for the
namespace that the runtime uses to trigger handlers. A threaded process
running within the container monitors the tail of the namespace log.  When a
call to *WooFPut()* specifies a handler, the code will append a TRIGGER record
to the log indicating that a handler must be triggered.  Threads within the
dispatch process claim TRIGGER records exclusively (and append their claims to
the log) and, once claimed, trigger the handler specified in the record.

Each container is also run with the ``-i'' option. As a result, if a
handler writes to standard out or standard error, the resulting output
will appear on the tty associated with the shell that launched the
platform. That is, the platform aggregates the standard out and standard
error file descriptors from all handlers executing in the namespace it
is managing.

Because the handler is actually executing in a separate process within a
namespace container, the process must execute bootstrap code to map the
WOOF and pass the sequence number to the handler. As a result, the
handler code must be wrapped in a C main() routine that is part of
CSPOT. This main() routine is contained in the file woofc-shepherd.c.

Additionally, it is possible to issue CSPOT API calls from outside
of a namespace so that CSPOT programs can communicate with external
users and programs.    

A call to *WooFPut()* or *WooFGet()* 
that specifies a fully-qualified URN will generate
network message (using link::https://zeromq.org[ZeroMQ]) when the call is from
an application component that is external to the namespace, or when CSPOT
determines that a handler is referencing a WOOF in another namespace. 
It is possible to use a Linux path name to reference a WOOF, but an external
process must make a call to *WooFInit()* before doing so to initialize the
runtime environment.  Handlers, however, inherit the environment in which they
are to execute and, thus, need not call *WooFInit()*.

== Example Applications

A CSPOT application consists of an initial Linux process that starts the
application by issuing one or more calls to *WooFPut()*, a set of
WOOFs that the application will access, and a set of handlers that the
runtime triggers optionally when data is appended to a WOOF. Each
handler must be wrapped by the code contained in woofc-shepherd.c so
that the API can find the internal runtime system log and also map the
WOOFs referred to in any API calls. The initial process must make a call
to *WooFInit()* after setting one or more environment variables
appropriately before it attempts to issue a *WooFPut()* call. All
of the namespace platforms must be running for the WOOFs that are
mentioned in the application or the application will not execute.

=== Build Model

The CSPOT runtime causes the namespace containers to mount the namespace
top-level directory from the host as a Docker volume. Each namespace
container assumes that the handler binary is compiled for the baseline
distribution used by the container (currently CentOS 7) and is present
in the top-level namespace directory before it is invoked.

The example applications contained in this repo build using make and
copy the binaries into the namespace. This methodology works when the
Linux distribution that is used to build CSPOT is matches the baseline
used in the containers (CentOS 7, at present). However, if the
distribution that builds CSPOT is different than the container
distribution, the in-container binaries should be built in a container,
separately, so that the dynamically loaded libraries are compatible.

=== Hello World (cspot/apps/hello-world)

The ``Hello world'' application consists of a single handler which
prints to the string ``Hello world'' and then prints a string that the
initial process has appended to the WOOF.

[source c]
----
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "woofc.h"
#include "hw.h"

int hw(WOOF *wf, unsigned long seq_no, void *ptr)
{
    HW_EL *el = (HW_EL *)ptr;
    fprintf(stdout,"hello world\n");
    fprintf(stdout,"from woof %s at %lu with string: %s\n",
                    wf->shared->filename, seq_no, el->string);
    fflush(stdout);
    return(1);

}
----

The header file woofc.h defines a C structure that the application uses
as the type of each element in the WOOF.

[source c]
----
#ifndef HW_H
#define HW_H
struct obj_stc
{
    char string[255];
};
typedef struct obj_stc HW_EL;
#endif
----

Finally, the initial start process takes a WOOF name to use, creates the
WOOF (with a history size of 5), types element as an HW_EL, fills in a
string, and calls *WooFPut()* with ``hw'' specified as a handler.

[source c]

	return(0);
}

----
The code for this application is in the apps/hello-world subdirectory of
the CSPOT repo.

 as is a makefile that assumes that CSPOT has already been
compiled in the main directory. The makefile creates a ``cspot''
subdirectory which is used as the namespace for the application. It it
also copies the binaries, when they are compiled, into this namespace
directory.

To run ``Hello world'', first start the namespace platform for the
application’s namespace. The easiest way to start the platform is to cd
into the namespace on the host and to run it without any arguments. It
will use the current working directory as the namespace in this case.

....
cd spot/apps/hello-world/cspot
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
./woofc-namespace-platform
....

Once the platform is running, it will spawn a Docker container.
Unfortunately, the interaction between pthreads, the Linux system
command, and docker isn’t completely bug free in CentOS 7. Currently,
woofc-namespace-platform can be terminated with a when running in the
foreground, but must be typed twice (the second causes SIGINT to be
caught). Alternatively, killing the process ID with ``kill -TERM'' will
also trigger a clean up of the docker container. Any other form of
termination may leave the container running which holds the port
associated with the namespace.

Once the platform is running, run the application

....
cd spot/apps/hello-world/cspot
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
./hw-start -W woof://<uri-for-woof-to-use>
....

Because the handler prints to stdout, the output of the handler will be
sent to the controlling tty of the shell that is running the platform.

=== Ping-pong (cspot/apps/ping-pong)

The ping-pong application uses a start program (``ping-pong-start'') and
two separate handlers (``ping'' and ``pong'') to alternatively increment
a shared counter carried in the WOOF. The makefile in
cspot/apps/ping-pong creates a cspot subdirectory to use as a namespace.
Thus, once the platform is running,

....
cd spot/apps/ping-pong/cspot
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
./ping-pong-start -s 10 -f pp-woof
....

will start the application. The ``-s'' parameter specifies the maximum
value of the counter. When the counter’s value reaches this value, the
application will stop. Thus, in this example, the counter will count to
10 before the application stops executing. Both handlers send output to
standard out which will appear on the controlling tty of the shell that
launched the platform.

The ping-pong application can also be run with two separate namespaces.
The name of the WOOF specified to the ``-f'' parameter will be created
in each namespace. Note that the makefile that is in the repo does not
create two namespaces automatically. To use this application in multiple
namespaces, create each and copy the binaries from the ``cspot''
subdirectory created by the name file into each namespace. The start
program, ``ping-pong-start'' takes a ``-N'' and ``-n'' argument which
must be used to specify the path, on the host, to each namespace.

Finally, the apps/ping-pong directory also includes a version that can
be run in two separate namespaces on two separate machines. It uses the
same handlers as the one that uses ping-pong-start, but initializing the
application is different.

Specifically, when run in two namespaces on the same machine,
ping-pong-start creates the WOOF specified with the ``-f'' argument in
both namespaces. WOOFC does not currently support the ability to create
a WOOF in a remote namespace (although it might need to at some point).
Thus, to run ping-pong between two separate machines, the application
needs a component that creates the WOOF on the machine that runs ping,
and another component that creates the WOOF on the machine that runs
pong. These components are ``ping-start'' and ``pong-start''
respectively.

To run this version, first run pong-start with a URI specification for
both namespaces and the name of the WOOF on the target machine (after
starting up the woof-namespace-platform for the local namespace). This
function will create the WOOF in the local namespace and exit. Then run
ping-start on the other machine (after the woof-namespace-platform is
running), again specifying both namespaces and the WOOF name as well as
the maximum counter value.

Note that pong-start need only be run once if the same WOOF is used for
multiple runs. Once the WOOF is created, ping-start can initiate
execution by putting to it.

So, for example, imagine that machine 1 has IP address 10.0.1.4 and
machine 2 has IP address 10.0.1.5 and that /tmp/cspot is a valid
namespace on both machines (i.e. it contains the ping and pong
handlers).

On machine 2, run

....
pong-start -N woof://10.0.1.4/tmp/cspot -n woof://10.0.1.5/tmp/cspot -f ping-pong-woof
....

This command creates the WOOF ping-pong-woof in the namespace (assuming
the platform is up and running for that namespace) and then exits. Then
on machine 1, run

....
ping-start -N woof://10.0.1.4/tmp/cspot -n woof://10.0.1.5/tmp/cspot -f ping-pong-woof -s 10
....

(again, assuming the platform is running) and it should initiate a
ping-pong between the two. Running ping-start again, with the same WOOF
will recreate the WOOF on machine 1, but use the existing WOOF on
machine 2 (which will be evident by the sequence numbers).

=== Runs Test (cspot/apps/runs-test)

The Runs test application is intended to simulate an IoT processing
pipeline. A producing handler (``RHandler in the application) generates
a stream of pseudo-random numbers. The next stage of the pipeline
(''SHandler”) processes the stream in batches of ``sample size''
(specified as the ``-s'' parameter) and compute the Runs test statistic
for each sample. It then puts each statistic in a WOOF for the final
stage of the pipeline (``KHandler'') which runs a KS-test for the set of
statistics against a z-transformed, empirically generated Normal
distribution of the same size. The number of such samples it considers
is specified by the ``-c'' parameter to the start program.

The apps/runs-test subdirectory contains several versions of this
program

* c-runstest.c: sequential C implementation
* c-runstat.c: C implementation using pthreads and shared memory in an
event-driven style
* cspot-runstat: CSPOT implementation of c-runstat running in a single
namespace
* cspot-runstat-fast: CSPOT implementation that does not run
``RHandler'' in a container
* cspot-runstat-multi-ns: CSPOT implementation of c-runstat that runs
handlers in separate namespaces

The makefile in this subdirectory creates both single and
multi-namespace versions for comparative purposes.

== On-going and Future Work

There is a lot left to do.

=== On Puts, Gets, Appends, and Reads

The minimalist initial API uses ****WooFPut()**** as the primary API
abstraction for moving state between application components. This
emphasis is intended to promote the use of append-only semantics in a
FaaS context. For IoT, doing so will (may) make it possible to program
_distributed_ IoT applications in a FaaS style.

However, it introduces an asymmetry between writing and reading program
state that may make application programming more difficult.
Specifically, all reads must be namespace local (requiring a
****WooFOpen()**** to obtain in internal WOOF handle). Logically, no
asymmetry is mandated. Thus it will be important to understand whether
building it into the API is useful or confusing.

The API design also influences the performance of the system. In
particular, mapping a WOOF into the memory space of a process running in
a container is a performance-expensive operation under the current
implementation supported by Linux. Thus, it is useful, as a
programmer-controlled optimization, to allow the mapping to be reused.
Because ****WooFPut()**** takes a WOOF name, it must first map the WOOF,
then do the put, and then unmap the WOOF (there are optimization
possibilities here, to be sure). To make make multiple puts to the same
WOOF more efficient, the API currently includes ****WooFAppend()****
which takes a handle returned from ****WooFOpen()**** (in the same way
****WooFRead()**** does) to a WOOF in the local namespace. Indeed,
****WooFPut()**** uses ****WooFAppend()**** internally. Its
implementation looks something like

....
unsigned long WooFPut(char *woof_name, char *handler_name, void *element)
{
   if(woof_name is a local WOOF) {
      woof = WooFOpen(woof_name);
      seq_no = WooFAppend(woof, handler_name, element);
      WooFFree(woof);
   } else {
      seq_no = send a put request to the put proxy for the WOOF's namespace
   }
   return(seq_no);
 }
....

=== I/O

I/O creates another related question that the project must investigate.
In particular, it is possible for a process outside of a namespace to
make a call to ****WooFPut()**** to introduce data but without an
analogous ****WooFGet()**** call, there is no way to get data back out
of a namespace. Thus the put/get API that, ultimately, is part of the
prototype is richer than the minimalist API:

* unsigned long ****WooFPut****(char __woof_name, char __handler_name,
void *element)
** #woof_name# is the local or fully qualified name of an existing WOOF
** #handler_name# is the name of a file in the WOOF’s namespace that
contains the handler code or NULL. When #handler_name# is NULL, no
handler will be triggered after the append of the element.
** #element# is an in parameter that points to an memory region to be
appended to the WOOF
** the call returns the sequence number of the element or a
representation of -1 on failure
** can be called from either wishing a handler or from a process outside
of a namespace
* int ****WooFGet****(char __woof_name, void __element, unsigned long
seq_no)
** #woof_name# is the local or fully qualified name of an existing WOOF
** #element# is an out parameter pointing to memory that will be filled
in by the specified WOOF element
** #seq_no# is the sequence number of the element to be returned through
the #element# pointer
** returns < 0 if the call fails to successfully return the element
** WOOF can either be in the local namespace or a remote namespace
* WOOF * ****WooFOpen****(char *woof_name)
** #woof_name# is the local or fully qualified name of an existing WOOF
** returns an opaque handle to an in-memory data structure referring to
the WOOF or NULL on failure
** if the WOOF is not in the local namespace, the call fails
* int WooFAppend(WOOF __woof, char __handler_name, void *element)
** #woof# is an opaque handle returned from a call to WooFOpen()
** #handler_name# is the name of a file in the WOOF’s namespace that
contains the handler code or NULL. When #handler_name# is NULL, no
handler will be triggered after the append of the element.
** #element# is an in parameter that points to an memory region to be
appended to the WOOF
** the call returns the sequence number of the element or a
representation of -1 on failure
** the WOOF must be in the local namespace
* int ****WooFRead****(WOOF __woof, void __element, unsigned long
seq_no)
** #woof# is an opaque handle returned from a call to WooFOpen()
** #element# is an out parameter pointing to memory that will be filled
in by the specified WOOF element
** #seq_no# is the sequence number of the element to be returned through
the #element# pointer
** returns < 0 if the call fails to successfully return the element
* void ****WooFFree****(WOOF *woof)
** releases the in-memory data structure created by a call to WooFOpen()

There are two possibilities for the API, long-term. The first is that
****WooFPut()**** and ****WooFGet()**** are symmetric meaning that they
can both be called from within a handler or outside of a namespace. From
an API design perspective, this option is attractive but it promotes the
use of WOOFs as random access memories from a read perspective. The
second option is that ****WooFGet()**** which turns out to be necessary
in some forms – see below) is restricted to be executed only _outside_
of a handler.

The current CSPOT implementation does not restrict ****WooFGet()**** –
it is symmetric with respect to ****WooFPut()****. However, the
applications will not use it to implement cross-namespace random access
memory in an attempt to determine if it should be restricted.

****WooFGet()**** turns out to be necessary in order to get application
state out of the application. That is, without ****WooFGet()**** the
final output of an application must reside inside a namespace (as a file
– not a WOOF). To get access to this state, then, the application user
must have read access to the Linux directory which implements the
namespace on the machine where the output is stored. Thus, it is
necessary to implement an API primitive to extract application state
from the various namespaces it uses (which is ****WooFGet()**** in the
current API). As mentioned above, there is a question regarding whether
****WooFGet()**** should be a _full-fledged_ CSPOT API call (symmetric
with respect to ****WooFPut()****) or not.

=== To Delete or Not to Delete – a Question of Access Controls

One glaring omission from the current API is a lack of a way to destroy
an existing WOOF. That’s not strictly true in the sense that
****WooFCreate()**** resets an existing WOOF if it already exists,
thereby overwriting its original contents. However, there is currently
no way to remove a WOOF permanently from a namespace.

Because WOOFs can grow and shrink (by being ``recreated'' with different
sizes) the argument for a destroy API call is one regarding WOOF name
conflicts within a namespace. That is, one wishes to remove a WOOF from
the namespace because the name conflicts with another name. However,
allowing the name to reused by a subsequent call to ****WooFCreate()****
simply delays the conflict resolution until the create. That is,
removing a name really only needs to happen when another create wants to
use the name.

This delayed binding of name conflict resolution is possible as long as
the access control permissions are not associated with the WOOF name. If
they are, then a ****WooFCreate()**** cannot resolve a name conflict
since the caller may not have permission to ``take over'' the name (and
thereby delete the WOOF’s contents).

It is possible to use something similar to user-group-world but then the
namespace cannot be flat. That is, each user would need to be able to
carve out a subtree within the namespace.

Another possibility is that namespaces carry access controls, but all
WOOFs within a namespace are viewed to be part of the same trust domain.
From the perspective of using messaging as an an authentication
mechanism (e.g. CURVE in ZeroMQ), this option makes the most sense, but
it then creates the possibility of a proliferation of namespaces.

The project must resolve this issue when determining the security model.
At present, there are no authentication mechanisms or access controls
implemented.
